/*---FIND_ROOTS_LIB---*/
In the same folder as the README file exists a Makefile
in order to compile the application find_roots_lib.
Run command: make
Once the compilation is terminated, you'll see a message:
"Compilation terminated successfully!"
At this point an executable file find_roots_lib has been created.
Finally, you can execute find_roots_lib simply by typing: ./find_roots_lib

/*---PROJECT1_MODULE---*/
In order to compile project1-kyber.c, change the current working 
directory to project1_module by typing: cd project1_module
In this directory, run command: make
At this point, the module is uploaded in the kernel
and it's ready for use.

/*---SYSFS_MODULE---*/
In order to compile sysfs_module.c, change the current working 
directory to sysfs_module by typing: cd sysfs_module
In this directory, run command: make
At this point, the module has created the sysfs file and the 
user can read it with command: cat <sysfs absolute path>
